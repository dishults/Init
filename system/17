ssh localhost

# or any other host from /etc/hosts

# In Debian in VirtualBox that works as it is.
# In vagrant would have to do a few extra steps first :

# 1. Generate public/private rsa key pair:
#   ssh-keygen
# 2. Manually add generated keys to authorized keys:
#   cat .ssh/id_rsa.pub >> .ssh/authorized_keys
# 3. Reboot SSH service:
#   sudo service ssh restart
